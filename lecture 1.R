# Data Analysis Using R
# Program R: Beginner



# Session 1: Introduction to R

# Get started: Creating an R  script
# Click File -> New File -> R Script
# The script editor opens with an empty script this is my first R script do some things
x = 34
y = 16
z = x + y # addition
w = y/x     # division
# display the results
x
y
z
w

# change x
x = "some text"

# display the results
x
y
z
w #why is w still giving us a value?

# To save: click File ->  Save as

# To open: double click on saved script file
# Run code: highlight/place cursor along code line and either: click run, or Press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Command + Enter (Mac)


# Basic Commands
x <- c(1, 6, 8, 10, 7, 5, 3, 14, 19, 6, 5, 1, 5, 3, NA)
max(x, na.rm = TRUE) # maximum removing missing data
min(x, na.rm = TRUE) # minimum removing missing data
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) #mean removing missing data
median(x, na.rm = T) #median removing missing data
sum(x, na.rm = T) #sum removing missing data
var(x, na.rm = T) #variance removing missing data
sd(x, na.rm = T) #standard deviation removing missing data
length(x) # number of items
summary(x) # produce result summaries of data models ..
table(x) # tabulation or crosstabulation
x[5] # List or subsetting- here the 5th item of dataset x

# Useful Functions
str(mtcars)
class(mtcars) # class or type of an object
names(mtcars) # names

vector1 <- c(1, 2, 3) # vector for use in examples below
vector2 <- c(4, 5, 6) # vector for use in examples below
c(vector1, vector2) # combine objects into a vector
cbind(vector1, vector2) # combine objects as columns
rbind(vector1, vector2) # combine objects as rows

ls()    # list current objects in workspace
rm(vector1) # delete an object from workspace

newobject <- edit(mtcars) # edit copy and save a newobject
fix(mtcars) # edit in place- replace original

#Points to note
# An example
x <- c(1:10) #Make vector of numbers from 1 to 10

x[(x > 8) | (x < 5)] # x greater than 8 and less than 5
# yields 1 2 3 4 9 10

# How it works
x <- c(1:10)
x

x > 8

x < 5


x > 8 | x < 5

x[c(T, T, T, T, F, F, F, F, T, T)]    


# Points to note
# To list the objects that you have in your current R session use the function ls or the function objects.
ls()

#To list all objects starting with the letter x:
x2 = 9
y2 = 10
ls(pattern = "x")

# Use the function rm to remove one or more objects from your session.
rm(x, x2)


# Lets create two small vectors with data and a scatterplot.
# concatenate function or c(), groups things together

z2 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
z3 <- c(6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 1)
plot(z2, z3)
title("My first scatterplot")

# R as a calculator
x = sin(9)/75
y = log(x) + x^2
x
y
m <- matrix(c(1, 2, 4, 1), ncol = 2, byrow = T)
